# Instructions  

Complete the method uniqueWords. Unique words should count the number of unique words in a text. Words that occur more than once should only be counted one time. 

You will need to clean the data to obtain an accurate count.

1. Hyphenated words should be counted as one word.
2. Case should not matter. For example, "The" and "the" should only be counted once.
3. Numbers and punctuation should not count as words. 
4. Words like its and it's should both be counted as seperate words.


```
For example: 
String str = "The one 2 Pick is the last one!!"
uniqueWords(str) returns 5.

String str = "I 'don't know' I dont know I owe $5.75";
uniqueWords(str) returns 5.

String str = "s; dP5 389m    j7zs;45 bz0 s.x4Dp"
uniqueWords(str) returns 7.

```

The Time Machine file should contain approximatly ~4,660 unique words.
