# Instructions  

Using a hash table, determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

 1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
 2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
 3. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

## Complete the following.

isValidSudoku method in the Main class and the HashTable class

The add method should return true if the value is added to the hash table otherwise it returns false if the value is already present.

## Hint

You will need anywhere from 13 to 27 hash tables. Consider implementing your hash tables as either char, int, or boolean arrays.
