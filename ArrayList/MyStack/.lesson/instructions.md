# Instructions  

The MyStack class represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of integers. The usual push and pop methods (operations) should be implemented, as well as a method to peek at the top item on the stack, a method to test for whether the stack is empty, and a method to search the stack for an item and discover how far it is from the top.

Your MyStack class should manage a hidden array of size 10 that will grow dynamically as needed. When a MyStack object is first created it contains no items.

The MyStack class implements the MyStackInterface. Please review the MyStackInterface for more information on the methods you will be to implementing.
